# Basic File Explorer

A very simple file explorer for Windows, built using the .NET framework and the MVVM architectural pattern.

The project has been in the works since 2022 and work on it was completed in 2023. However, it is possible that I will return to the project in the future and add new features.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Please note

The application may appear to be very unstable. No major problems have been discovered during testing, but I must warn you to approach the application with extreme caution.
